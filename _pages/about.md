I am currently a Ph. D. student at [National institute of scientific research](https://inrs.ca/en/) (INRS), at the [Water Earth and Environment Research Center](https://inrs.ca/en/inrs/research-centres/eau-terre-environnement-research-centre/), in Quebec City, Canada. My research interests are related to the applications of statistics and data science to concrete environmental problematics, such as hydrometeorology, climate change, environmental health and ecology.
