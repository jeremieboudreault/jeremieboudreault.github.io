Hello! I am Jérémie Boudreault, a PhD student-researcher at the National institute of scientific research of Quebec (INRS), and a lecturer at Laval University.

My research focuses on modelling the health, economic and environmental impacts of climate hazards such as extreme heat and flooding. To that end, I leverage both novel statistical models and AI/machine learning approaches. Prior to my PhD, I worked for several years as a research scientist in climate risk modelling. My current and past projects are available [here](https://jeremieboudreault.github.io/projects/). 


News 🆕
----------

* Our literature review on [machine learning for modelling heat-related health impacts](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2025.109965) was published in *Environment International*.
* Our general public article on [the Paris Agreement and heat-related health costs](https://climatoscope.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Pages-from-Le_Climatoscope_Num7_2025_Boudreault.pdf) was published in Le Climatoscope.

Hiring 🚨
