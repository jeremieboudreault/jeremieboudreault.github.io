Hello! I am Jérémie Boudreault, a PhD student-researcher at the National institute of scientific research of Quebec (INRS), and a lecturer at Laval University.

My research focuses on modelling the health, economic and environmental impacts of climate hazards such as extreme heat and flooding. To that end, I leverage both novel statistical models and AI/machine learning approaches. Prior to my PhD, I worked for several years as a research scientist in climate risk modelling. My current and past projects are available [here](https://jeremieboudreault.github.io/projects/).
