Hello! I am Jérémie Boudreault, a PhD student-researcher at the National institute of scientific research of Quebec (INRS), and a lecturer at Laval University.

My research focuses on modelling the health, economic and environmental impacts of climate hazards such as extreme heat and flooding. To that end, I leverage both novel statistical models and AI/machine learning approaches. Prior to my PhD, I worked for several years as a research scientist in climate risk modelling. My current and past projects are available [here](https://jeremieboudreault.github.io/projects/). 


News 🆕
----------

* Our article on the Paris Agreement and heat-related health costs was published in [Le Climatoscope]
* Our work on heat-related mortality and medications was featured in [L'Express](https://www.lexpress.fr/sciences-sante/sante/les-medicaments-aggravent-ils-la-mortalite-lors-des-canicules-enquete-sur-une-zone-dombre-DY32OYRWJBH3XBDGC3VLKGRSKU/) in France.
