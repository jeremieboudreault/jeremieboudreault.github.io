-------------------

*As part of my Ph. D. at INRS and my research internships at INSPQ and BCCDC/UBC.*

- Modelling the heat-related health impacts using machine and deep learning models
- Estimating the heat burden and associated health costs with projected climate change
- Analyzing vulnerability factors to extreme heat such as medication use and schizophrenia 

*An example of results for health costs in Quebec* :
